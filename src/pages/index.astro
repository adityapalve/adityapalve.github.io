  <h1>Aditya Palve</h1>
  
  <p>
    Hello! I'm a developer interested in building things that matter. 
    I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology, design, and human experience.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Currently working on projects that span NLP, data visualization, and creative tools.
    When I'm not coding, I'm likely reading, walking, or photographing the world around me.
